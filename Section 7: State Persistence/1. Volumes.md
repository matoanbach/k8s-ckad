## Volumes in Kubernetes

#### Scenario

- A pod generates a random number between 1 and 100 and writes it to a file located at `/opt/number.out`. Without a volume, when the pod terminates, this file is lost.

#### Solution

- To retain the file:
  1. Volume: Create a volume in Kubernetes
  2. Storage: Specify where this volume stores data
  3. Volume Mounts: Attach the volume to a directory inside the container

#### Example

- Volume: Configured to use the `/data` directory on the host.
- Volume Mount: Mounted inside the container at `/opt`.
- Now, the random number written to `/opt/number.out` is backed by the `/data` directory on the host. Even if the pod is deleted, the data persists.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: random-number-generator
  spec:
    containers:
      - image: alpine
        name: alpine
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: ["shuf -i 0-100 -n 1 >> /opt/number.out"]
        volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /opt
            name: data-volume
    volumes:
      - name: data-volume
        hostPath:
          path: "/data"
          type: Directory
  ```

## Volume Storage Options

- Kubernetes supports multiple volume types for storage:

### 1. Host Path: Uses a directory on the host node.

- Best suited for single-node clusters.
- Limitation: In multi-node clusters, `/data` on one node is not replicated to other nodes.

### 2. Network Storage: Replicated and shared across nodes.

- Examples:
  - NFS
  - Cluster FS
  - Ceph
  - GlusterFS

### 3. Cloud-Based Storage:

- AWS: Elastic Block Store (EBS)
- Azure: Managed Disks
- Google Cloud: Persistent Disks

#### AWS Example

```yaml
volumes:
  - name: data-volume
    awsElasticBlockStore:
      volumeID: <volume-id>
      fsType: ext4
```
