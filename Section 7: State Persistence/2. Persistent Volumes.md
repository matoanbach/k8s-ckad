## Persistent Volumes (PV) Overview

#### Problem with Regular Volumes:

- In the previous section, volumes were configured directly in the pod definition. This approach has drawbacks:
  - Every pod requires manual configuration of storage.
  - Changes must be made to every pod definition file when needed.
  - Lack of centralized storage management.

#### Solution:

- Kubernetes introduces Persistent Volumes (PV) for centralized storage management:
  - Administrator: Sets up a pool of storage as Persistent Volumes.
  - Users: Request storage from this pool using Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).

## How Persistent Volumes Work

#### Administrator's Role:

- Creates a PV using a YAML definition file.
- Configures the PV with specific access modes, capacity, and storage backend (e.g., AWS EBS, NFS).

#### User's Role:

- Submits a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) to request storage.
- Kubernetes matches the PVC to an available PV.

#### Creating a Persistent Volume

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-vol1
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  awsElasticBlockStore:
    volumeID: <volume-id>
    fsType: ext4
```

```
kubectl create -f pv-definition.yaml
```

```
kubectl get persistentvolume
```
