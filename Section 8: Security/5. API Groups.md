### 1. API Groups:

- Kubernetes organizes its APIs into Core and Named Groups.
- The Core API Group includes fundamental resources like pods, services, config maps, persistent volumes (PVs), and persistent volume claims (PVCs). It uses the base path `/api/v1`.
- Named API Groups provide more modular and specific functionalities like networking, storage, and authentication. They are accessed through `/apis/{group-name}/{version}`.

### 2. Core API Group

- Resources such as namespaces, `pods`, `rc (replication controllers)`, `configmaps`, and `services` fall under this group.
- These resources are foundational for basic Kubernetes operations.

### 3. Named API Groups

- apps.k8s.io: Manages resources like `deployments`, `replica sets`, and `stateful sets`.
- networking.k8s.io: Deals with `network policies`.
- storage.k8s.io: Manages storage classes and other storage-related resources.
- certificates.k8s.io: Handles certificate signing requests.

### 4. Resources and Verbs:

- Resources within API groups (like `pods`, `deployments`) have associated verbs (actions), such as:
  - List: Fetch a list of resources.
  - Get: Fetch details of a specific resource.
  - Create: Add a new resource.
  - Update/Delete: Modify or remove a resource.
  - Watch: Monitor changes to resources.

### 5. Accessing the API:

- To access resources, the base URL of the Kubernetes API server is followed by the path to the group and resource.
- Example: `/apis/apps/v1/deployments` retrieves the deployments resource from the `apps` group.

### 6. kubectl Proxy:

- To interact with the API securely without passing certificates or tokens in every command, you can use `kubectl proxy`. This creates a local HTTP proxy that forwards requests to the Kubernetes API server using your kubeconfig credentials.
