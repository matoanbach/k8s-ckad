## Kubernetes Admission Controllers Lecture

### Introduction to Admission Controllers

- **Purpose**: Implement enhanced security measures and manage operations within a Kubernetes cluster.
- **Functionality**: Go beyond RBAC by modifying requests and performing additional actions before object creation.

### Current Process in Kubernetes

- **Request Flow**:

  - Sent to API server via `kubectl`.
  - Authenticated using certificates (e.g., in kubeconfig).
  - Authorized through role-based access control (RBAC).

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Allows or denies operations based on assigned user roles.
  - Restricts actions like creating, listing, or deleting objects.

### Limitations of RBAC

- **API Level Restrictions**: Does not address detailed configuration constraints.
- **Example Needs**:
  - Validate image registry sources.
  - Prohibit the use of "latest" image tags.
  - Refuse requests with containers running as root.

### Admission Controllers: An Introduction

- **Purpose**: Address limitations of RBAC by enforcing detailed constraints.
- **Functionality**:
  - Validate, modify, and extend request handling.
  - Implement specific rules (e.g., image source restrictions, metadata labels).

### Built-In Admission Controllers

- **Examples**:
  - **Always Pull Images**: Ensures images are always pulled when creating pods.
  - **Default Storage Class**: Automatically assigns storage classes to PVCs.
  - **Event Rate Limit**: Limits handled requests to prevent flooding.
  - **Namespace Exists**: Rejects requests to non-existent namespaces.

### Managing Admission Controllers

- **Listing Enabled Controllers**:
  - Run:
    ```bash
    kubectl-apiserver -h | grep enable-admission-plugins
    kubectl exec kube-apiserver-controlplane -n kube-system -- kube-apiserver -h | grep enable-admission-plugins
    ```
- **Adding/Disabling Controllers**:
  - Update the "enable-admission-plugins" or "disable-admission-plugins" flag in kube-apiserver configurations.
  - In kubeadm setups, modify kube-apiserver manifest files.

##### Since the kube-apiserver is running as pod you can check the process to see enabled and disabled plugins.

```bash
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep admission-plugins
```
