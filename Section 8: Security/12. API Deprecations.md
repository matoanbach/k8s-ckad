## Understanding API Versioning and Deprecation Policy

### Why Support Multiple API Versions?

- Single API groups can support multiple versions simultaneously to ensure:
  - Compatibility with existing users.
  - Flexibility for gradual feature rollouts and deprecations.
- Key Questions:
  - How many versions should you support?
  - When can you remove an older version?

### API Lifecycle Overview

- Alpha Phase:
  - Example: V1 Alpha 1.
  - New API features introduced.
  - Not required to retain older alpha versions after updates.
- Beta Phase:
  - Example: V1 Beta 1, V1 Beta 2.
  - Requires previous beta versions to be supported for 9 months or 3 releases.
- GA (Stable) Phase:
  - Example: V1.
  - Older GA versions must be supported for 12 months or 3 releases.

### API Deprecation Policy Rules

1. Version Increment for Removal:
   - API elements can only be removed by incrementing the version.
   - Example: Removing a resource from V1 Alpha 1 requires releasing V1 Alpha 2.
2. Round-Trip Compatibility:
   - API objects must convert seamlessly between versions in a release without data loss.
   - Example:
     - Field Duration added in V1 Alpha 2.
     - Equivalent field must exist in V1 Alpha 1 for backward compatibility.
3. Deprecation Timing:
   - New stable (GA) versions are required before deprecating older ones.
   - Example: V2 Alpha 1 cannot deprecate V1 (GA); it must progress to V2 (GA) first.
4. Support Periods:
   - Alpha: Not required to retain older versions after updates.
   - Beta: Must support deprecated versions for 9 months or 3 releases.
   - GA: Must support deprecated versions for 12 months or 3 releases.

### Introducing a New API Version (V2)

- V2 Alpha 1 cannot deprecate V1 (GA).
- Must progress through its lifecycle to reach V2 (GA) before deprecating V1.

### Updating Manifest Files

- Use the kubectl convert command to update YAML files to newer API versions.
  ```bash
  kubectl convert -f old.yaml --output-version=apps/v1 > new.yaml
  ```

#### What is the preferred version for `authorization.k8s.io`

```bash
kubectl proxy 8001
```

```bash
curl localhost:8001/apis/authorization.k8s.io
```

#### Install kubectl-convert

```bash
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl-convert"
```

```bash
chmod +x kubectl-convert
```

```bash
mv kubectl-convert /usr/local/bin
```
