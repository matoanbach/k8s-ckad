### 1. Host-Level Security:

- Secure the underlying infrastructure hosting Kubernetes:
  - Disable root access.
  - Use SSH key-based authentication (disable password-based access).
  - Secure physical/virtual hosts to prevent compromise.

### 2. API Server Security:

- Authentication:

  - Determine who can access the API server.
  - Authentication methods include:
    - Static user IDs and passwords.
    - Tokens.
    - Certificates.
    - External authentication providers (e.g., LDAP).
    - Service accounts for machine authentication.

- Authorization:
  - Determine what authenticated users can do.
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
    - Users are assigned roles and permissions via RBAC.
  - Other mechanisms: Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), node authorizers, etc.

### 3. Cluster Component Communication:

- Secure communication between Kubernetes components (e.g., etcd, kube-controller-manager, API server, kubelet) using TLS encryption.
- Certificate setup and management are essential.

### 4. Application-Level Communication:

- Default Behavior:
  - Pods within the cluster can communicate freely with each other by default.
- Restricting Communication:
  - Use network policies to define and restrict traffic flow between pods.
