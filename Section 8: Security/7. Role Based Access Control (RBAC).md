## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes

- RBAC is a mechanism in Kubernetes to control access and define what a user or group of users can do within a cluster.

#### Why Use RBAC?

- To provide fine-grained control over access to resources.
- Differentiate access levels for different users like administrators, developers, testers, and service accounts.
- Restrict access to specific namespaces or resources to ensure security and avoid accidental operations.

### Creating a Role

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: developer
  namespace: default
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["list", "get", "create", "update", "delete"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["configmaps"]
    verbs: ["create"]
```

- Alternative:

```
kubectl create role developer --verb=list,create,delete --resources=pods
```

```

```

- This role allows users to:
  - View (list, get) pods.
  - Create, update, and delete pods.
  - Create config maps.

### Creating a Role Binding

- A RoleBinding links the role to a user or group.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: devuser-developer-binding
  namespace: default
subjects:
  - kind: User
    name: dev-user
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: developer
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

- Alternative:

```
kubectl create rolebinding dev-user-binding --role=developer --user=dev-user
```

- This binding assigns the `developer` role to the user `dev-user` in the `default` namespace.

### Commands to View and Manage Roles & Bindings

#### 1. View Roles:

```shell
kubectl get roles
```

#### 2. View Role Bindings

```shell
kubectl get rolebindings
```

#### 3. Describe a Role:

```shell
kubectl describe role developers
```

#### 4. Describe a Role Binding

```shell
kubectl describe rolebinding devuser-developer-binding
```

### Testing Permissions

- Use the `kubectl auth can-i` command to verify user permissions:
- Examples:
- Check if you can create deployments:

```bash
kubectl auth can-i create deployments
```

- Check if `dev-user` can create pods:

```bash
kubectl auth can-i create pods --as dev-user
```

### Restricting Specific Resource Access

- You can further restrict access to specific resources by adding the resourceNames field in the Role. For example:

```yaml
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    resourceNames: ["blue-pod", "orange-pod"]
    verbs: ["get", "update"]
```
