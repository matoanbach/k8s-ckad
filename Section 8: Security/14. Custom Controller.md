### What is a Custom Controller?

#### Definition:

- A process or code that runs in a loop and listens for events on specific objects (e.g., FlightTicket).

#### How It Works:

- Monitors object status in Kubernetes (via the API server).
- Executes actions in response to events (e.g., API calls to book/cancel tickets).

### Options for Building a Custom Controller

#### 1. Install Go Programming Language:

```
go version
```

#### 2. Clone the Sample Controller Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller.git
```

```bash
cd sample-controller
```

#### 3. Customize `controller.go`:

- Modify `controller.go` to include your logic.
- Example logic:
  - Watch for `FlightTicket` object events.
  - Call external APIs to book or cancel flight tickets.

#### 4. Build the Controller:

```bash
go build -o sample-controller .
```

#### 5. Run the Controller:

- Execute the controller:
  ```bash
  ./sample-controller -kubeconfig=$HOME/.kube/config
  ```
- The controller:
  - Authenticates with Kubernetes using the kubeconfig file.
  - Starts watching for `FlightTicket` events.

### Deploying the Controller

- Why Package the Controller?
  - Avoid manually building and running the controller each time.
- Steps:
  1. Package the controller as a Docker image.
  2. Deploy it to the Kubernetes cluster as a Pod or Deployment.
  3. Ensure the controller is always running to manage FlightTicket resources.
