### 1. Why Authorization?

- Different users (e.g., administrators, developers, testers) and services (e.g., monitoring tools) need varying levels of access.
- For example, developers might need permission to deploy applications but not modify cluster configurations.

### 2. Authorization Mechanisms in Kubernetes:

#### Node Authorization:

- Specifically for internal cluster components like kubelets.
- Grants kubelets access to nodes, pods, services, and status updates.
- Requests must originate from the `system:nodes` group with `system:node-prefixed` names.

#### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):

- Associates users or groups with permissions through a JSON policy file.
- Example: Allow `dev-user` to `view`, `create`, and `delete` pods.
- Difficult to manage because changes require file edits and API server restarts.

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

- Creates roles with specific permissions.
- Associates users or groups to roles for centralized management.
- Example: A "Developer" role grants all developers similar permissions, simplifying updates.

#### Webhook Authorization:

- Offloads authorization decisions to an external service, such as the Open Policy Agent (OPA).
- Kubernetes makes API calls to the service, which evaluates and returns allow/deny decisions.

### 3. Default Authorization Modes:

#### AlwaysAllow

- Allows all requests without checks. (Default if no mode is specified.)

#### AlwaysDeny

- Denies all requests without checks.

### 4. Chaining Authorization Modules:

- Multiple authorization modes can be specified in the `--authorization-mode` option for the API server (e.g., `Node,RBAC,Webhook`).
- The order matters:
  - If the Node authorizer denies a request, the next mode (e.g., RBAC) processes it.
  - If one mode approves the request, no further checks occur.
