### What are Readiness Probes?

- A readiness probe is a test configured in the Pod definition file to verify whether the application inside a container is ready to serve traffic

### How Readiness Probes work

1. Kubernetes checks the readiness probe before setting the Pod's <code>Ready</code> condition to true.
2. If the probe fails:
   - The Pod is marked as not read
   - Traffic is not routed to the Pod until the probe passes
3. Once the probe passes, the Pod's <code>Ready</code> condition is set to true, and traffic can be routed to it

### Types of Readiness Probes

#### 1. HTTP Probes:

- Used to check if an HTTP server is responding
- Example:
  ```
  readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
          path: /api/ready
          port: 8080
      initialDelaySeconds: 10
      periodSeconds: 5
  ```

#### 2. TCP Socket Probes

- Checks if a specific TCP port is open and listening
- Example:
  ```
  readinessProbe:
      tcpSocket:
          port: 3306
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 10
  ```

#### 3. Exec Probes:

- Runs a command inside the container. If the command exits successfully, the probe passes
- Example:
  ```
  readinessProbe:
      exec:
          command:
          - cat
          - /tmp/healthy
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 10
  ```

### Readiness Probe Configuration Options

1. <code>initialDelaySeconds</code>: Time to wait after the container starts before performing the first probe
2. <code>periodSeconds</code>: Frequenct of probe checks
3. <code>failureThreshold</code>: Number of failed probes before making the Pod as not ready
4. <code>successThreshold</code>: Number of successful probes required to mark the Pod as ready

### Readiness Probes in Multi-Pod Setups

- In scenarios with multiple Pods (e.g., deployments or replica sets), readiness probes ensure:
  - Traffic is only routed to Pods that are fully ready
  - New Pods are added to the service only after they pass the readiness probe
  - Existing Pods can serve traffic without disruptions during updates or scaling
- Example:
  - Suppose a deployment has 2 Pods already serving traffic
  - Adding a 3rd Pod without a readiness probe:
    - Traffic might immediately route to the new Pod, even if it's not ready, disrupting user experience
  - Adding a 3rd Pod with a readiness probe:
    - Traffic will onyl route to the new Pod once it passes the readiness probe, ensuring seamless user experience.
