# Monitoring a Kubernetes Cluster

This section explains how to monitor a Kubernetes cluster, focusing on **node-level** and **pod-level** metrics. We'll cover basic monitoring using the **Metrics Server** and how to view performance metrics in real-time.

## What to Monitor in Kubernetes?

### Node-Level Metrics

- Number of nodes in the cluster.
- Health status of nodes.
- Performance metrics:
  - CPU
  - Memory
  - Network
  - Disk utilization.

### Pod-Level Metrics

- Number of running pods.
- Performance metrics:
  - CPU consumption.
  - Memory consumption.

To monitor these metrics, we need a solution that can:

1. Collect metrics from nodes and pods.
2. Aggregate and store the data.
3. Provide analytics.

## Monitoring Solutions for Kubernetes

### Options Available

Kubernetes does not include a built-in full-featured monitoring solution. Here are some common options:

- **Open-Source**:
  - Metrics Server (basic monitoring).
  - Prometheus.
  - The Elastic Stack (formerly ELK Stack).
- **Proprietary**:
  - Datadog.
  - Dynatrace.

## The Metrics Server

For this guide, we focus on the **Metrics Server**, a lightweight and easy-to-set-up monitoring solution.

### Features

- Provides basic CPU and memory metrics for nodes and pods.
- Runs as a deployment within the Kubernetes cluster.
- **In-Memory Storage**:
  - Metrics are stored temporarily in memory.
  - Does not store historical data.

## How Metrics Server Works

### Kubernetes Components

1. **Kubelet**:

   - Runs on every node.
   - Responsible for managing pods and communicating with the Kubernetes API server.
   - Includes **cAdvisor** (Container Advisor) to collect container metrics.

2. **Metrics Server**:
   - Aggregates metrics from all Kubelets in the cluster.
   - Makes metrics available via Kubernetes APIs.

## Setting Up the Metrics Server

### Minikube

1. Enable the Metrics Server addon:
   ```bash
   minikube addons enable metrics-server
   ```

### Other Environments

1. Clone the Metrics Server repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server
```

2. Deploy the Metrics Server components:

```
kubectl apply -f metrics-server/deploy/
```

## Viewing Metrics

### Node Metrics

- View CPU and memory usage of nodes:

```
kubectl top node
```

### Pod Metrics

- View CPU and memory usage of pods:

```
kubectl top pod
```
