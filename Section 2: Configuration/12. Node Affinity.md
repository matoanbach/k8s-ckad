### Purpose of Node Affinity

- The primary purpose of node affinity is to ensure that Pods are scheduled on specific nodes based on rules you define. For instance:
  - You want to ensure a large data processing Pod is placed on Node 1, which has higher hardware resources

### How Node Affinity Works

- Node affinity allows you to define complex rules for Pod placement using key-value pairs and operators. While it adds more flexibility, it aslo increases complexity compared to nodeSelectors.

#### Example YAML with Node Affinity

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: myapp-pod
spec:
    containers:
    - name: data-processor
      image: data-processor
   affinity:
      nodeAffinity:
         requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
               - key: size
                  operator: In
                  values:
                  - large
```

- This achieves the same result as a nodeSelector: the Pod will be placed on a node labeled with <code>size=large</code>

### Key Components of Node Affinity

1. Affinity and Node Affinity:
   - Defined under <code>spec</code>
   - contains the rules for scheduling Pods on nodes
2. RequiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
   - This property defines when and how node affinity rules are applied
   - It ensures Pods are placed on nodes that match the specified rules during scheduling, but ignores these rules once the Pod is running
3. NodeSelectorTerms:
   - Contains the actual rules for matching nodes based on labels
   - These rules are written as expressions with:
     - <code>key</code>: The node lable
     - <code>operator</code>: Defines how the key and values are matched (e.g., In, NotIn, Exists)
     - <code>values</code>: a list of acceptable values for the key

#### Operators in Node Affinity

1. In:
   - Matches nodes where the lable has any of the specified values
   - Example: <code>key: size, operator: In, values: [large, medium]</code>
2. NotIn:
   - Matches nodes where the label value is not in the specified list
   - Example: <code>key: size, operator: NotIn, values: [large, medium]</code>
3. Exists:
   - Matches nodes where the label exists, regardless of its value
   - Example: <code>key: size, operator: exists</code>

### Affinity Types

- Node affinity can be applied during two stages in a Pod's lifecycle:
  1. During Scheduling:
     - Rules are considered when the Pod is being schedules
  2. During Execution:
     - Rules are checked after the Pod is already running

#### Available Affinity Types

1. RequiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
   - Pods must be scheduled on nodes that meet the affinity rules
   - Once scheduled, the rules are ignored during execution, meaning Pods are not affected by changes in node labels
2. PreferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
   - The scheduler tries to place Pods on matching nodes but falls back to other nodes if no match is found
   - Example: If no <code>size=large</code> node is available, the Pod will scheduled on any available node

### Behavior During Execution

- Currently, both types of node affinity (required and preferred) ignore affinity rules once the Pod is running. For example:
  - If a node's label <code>size=large</code> is removed, Pods already running on that ndoe are unaffected

### Planned Features

- A new type of node affinity is expected in the future:
  1. RequiredDuringSchedulingRequiredDuringExecution:
     - Ensures Pods must meet affinity rules both during scheduling and during execution
     - Example:
       - If the label <code>size=large</code> is removed from a node, any Pod replying on this label will be evicted (terminated)


### When to Use Node affinity
1. RequiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
    - Use when the Pod must run on specific nodes during scheduling
    - Example: Resource-heavy workloads like data processing
2. PreferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
    - Use when it's preferable for the Pod to run on specific nodes, but it can run on others if no match is found
    - Exampe: Non-critical workloads
