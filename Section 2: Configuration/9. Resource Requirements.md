### Units
- 1 G (Gigabyte) = 1,000,000,000 bytes
- 1 M (Megabyte) = 1,000,000 bytes
- 1 K (Kilobyte) = 1,000 bytes

- 1 Gi (Gibibyte) = 1,073,741,824 bytes (2³⁰)
- 1 Mi (Mebibyte) = 1,048,576 bytes (2²⁰)
- 1 Ki (Kibibyte) = 1,024 bytes (2¹⁰)



### Understanding Resource Allocation

- Imagine a three-node k8s cluster where each node has a set amount of CPU and memory resources
- Every Pod in the cluster requires a specific amount of resources to run. For example:
  - A Pod might need 2 CPUs and 1 memory unit

When a Pod is scheduled on a node:

1. It consumes resources available on that node.
2. The k8s scheduler decides which node to replace the Pod on by:
   - Checking the Pod's resource requirements
   - Identifying nodes with sufficient resources

### Scheduler Behavior

- If a node has sufficient resources, the Pod is scheduled there.
- If no nodes have enough resources:
  - The scheduler holds back scheduling the Pod
  - The pod enters the Pending state

### Specifying Resource Requests

- Resource requests define the minimum amount of CPU and memory a Pod needs
- Example:
  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
      name: simple-webapp-color
      lables:
          name: simple-webapp-color
  spec:
      containers:
          - name: simple-webapp-color
            image: simple-webapp-color
            ports:
              - containerPort: 8080
            resources:
              requests:
                  memory: "4Gi"
                  cpu: 2
  ```
- The scheduler uses these values to ensure the Pod gets a guaranteed amount of resources

### CPU Units:

- 1 CPU = 1 vCPU (AWS) = 1 core (GCP/Azure) = 1 hyperthread
- CPU values can fractional:
  - 0.1 CPU = 100m (mili-CPU)
  - Minimum value: 1m

### Memory Units

- Specify memory in GiB (gibibytes) or MB (megabytes)
  - GiB = 1024 MiB (binary standard)
  - GB = 1000 MB (decimal standard)

### Setting Resource Limits

- By default, containers can consume unlimited resources
- You can set limits to prevent a container from over-consuming

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: simple-webapp-color
    labels:
        name: simple-webapp-color
spec:
    containers:
    - name: simple-webapp-color
      image: simple-webapp-color
      ports:
      - containerPort: 8080
      resources:
        requests:
            memory: "1Gi"
            cpu: 1
        limits:
            memory: "2Gi"
            cpu: 2
```

### Behavior When Limits are exceeded

1. CPU: The system throttles CPU usage, preventing the container from exceeding the limit
2. Memory: The container is terminated with an Out of Memory (OOM) error if it exceeds the memory limit

### Scenarios for Requests and Limits

1. No Requests or Limits:
   - Pods can consume all resources, starving other Pods
2. Limits only:
   - Requests are automatically set equal to limits
   - Pods are guaranteed resources up to the limit
3. Requests and Limits set:
   - Pods have guaranteed resources (requests) but cannot exceed the limits.
4. Requests Only (Recommended):
   - Pods are guaranteed resources but can use extra resources if available

### Using LimitRanges

- Impact: only applues to new Pods; exisitng Pods are unaffected

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
    name: cpu-resource-constraint
    labels:
        name: cpu-resource-constraint
spec:
    limits:
        - default:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 500m
          defaultRequest:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 500m
          max:
            cpu: "1"
            memory: "1"
          min:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 100m
          type: Container
```

### Resource Quotas

- To limit total resource consumption in a namespace:
  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ResourceQuota
  metadata:
      name: my-resource-quota
  spec:
      hard:
          requests.cpu: 4
          requests.memory: 4Gi
          limits.cpu: 10
          limits.memory: 10Gi
  ```
