### Understanding Taints and Tolerations

- Imagine a bug approaching a person. To prevent the bug from landing on the person, you spray the person with repellent spray. In Kubernetes terms, the spray is a taint, and the bug has a toleration level to the spray.

  - If the bug is intolerant, it avouds landing on the person
  - If the bug is tolerant, it can still land on the person despite the spray

- In Kubernetes:
  - The person is a node
  - The bug is a pod

### Purpose of Taints and Tolerations

- Taints and tolerations are used to set restrictions on what pods can be scheduled on which nodes
- Taints are applied to nodes
- Tolerations are applied to pods

### Scenario: Scheduling Pods

1. Imagin a cluster with three worker nodes (Node 1, Node 2, and Node 3) and four pods (A, B, C, and D)
2. Initially, there are no restrictions, so the scheduler balances the pods evenly across the nodes.

### Using taints

- Now, suppose Node 1 is dedicated to a specific application. We:
  1. Add a taint to Node 1. For example, app=blue
  2. By default, pods have no tolerations, so none of the pods can be scheduled on Node 1.

### Using Tolerations

- To allow certain pods to be palced on Node 1:
  1. Add a toleration to Pod D, allowing it to tollerate the <code>app=blue</code> taint
  2. Now, Pod D can be scheduled on Node 1, while other pods are placed on other nodes.

### How to Apply Taints and Tolerations

#### Adding a Taint to a Node:

```
kubectl taint nodes <node-name> <key>=<value>:<effect>
```

- For example:
  ```
  kubectl taint nodes node1 app=blue:NoSchedule
  ```
- Effects of Taints:
  1. NoSchedule: Prevents pods without tolerations from being scheduled on the node
  2. PreferNoSchedule: Tries to avoid scheduling pods on the node but does not guarantee it
  3. NoExecute: Prevents new pods from bein scheduled and evicts existing pods that do not tolerate the taint.

#### Adding a toleration to a Pod:

- Modify the Pod definition file:
  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: pod
  metadata:
      name: myapp-pod
  spec:
      containers:
          - name: nginx-container
            image: nginx
      tolerations:
          - key: "app"
            operator: "Equal"
            value: "blue"
            effect: "NoSchedule"
  ```

### Behavior with NoExecute Effect

- When a node is tainted with <code>NoExecute</code>, it evicts any pods on the node that do not tolerate the taint.
- Example:
  - Node 1 is tainted with <code>app=blue:NoExecute</code>
  - Pod C (without toleration) is evicted fron Node 1.
  - Pod D (with toleration) remains on Node 1

### Important Notes

1. Taints and tolerations do not force a pod to a specific ode
   - They only restrict certain nodes from accepting pods
   - If Node 1 has a tain but no other nodes are restricted, Pod D could still be scheduled on other nodes
2. Master Node Behavior:
   - The master node is automatically tainted with <code>NoSchedule</code> to prevent application workloads from being deployed on it
   - To see this, run:
   ```
   kubectl describe node <master-node-name>
   ```
   - It is best practice to avoid deploying workloads on master nodes.

### Remove tain from a node

```
kubectl taint node controlplane node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule-
```
