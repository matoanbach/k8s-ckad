## Key Concepts

1. Workloads in Docker:

- A Docker container can perform a task (e.g., math computation) and exit.
- The container state becomes Exited, and the return code indicates success (0) or failure.

2. Workloads in Kubernetes:

- Kubernetes pods are typically designed to restart automatically (restartPolicy: Always).
- For one-time tasks, use restartPolicy: Never or OnFailure.

3. Jobs in Kubernetes:

- Jobs ensure tasks are completed successfully.
- Jobs can manage multiple pods for parallel or sequential task execution.

## Creating A job

1. Definition File:

- The job definition file specifies kind: <code>Job</code>.
- Uses <code>apiVersion: batch/v1</code>.
- Contains a <code>template</code> section for pod specification.

```
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
    name: math-add-job
spec:
    template:
        spec:
            containers:
                - name: math-add
                  image: ubuntu
                  command: ["expr", "2", "+", "3"]
            restartPolicy: Never
```

2. Create Job:

```
kubectl create -f job-definition.yaml
```

3. View Job:
   - Check job status:
     ```
     kubectl get jobs
     ```
   - Check pods created by the job:
     ```
     kubectl get pods
     ```
4. View logs:
   - View standard output of a job:
   ```
   kubectl logs <pod-name>
   ```
5. Delete Job:
   - Deleting the job also deletes its pods:
   ```
   kubectl delete job <job-name>√ç
   ```

## Running Multiple Pods

### 1. Sequential Execution

- Use <code>completions</code> to specify the number of pods to complete
  ```
  spec:
    completions: 3
  ```

### 2. Parallel Execution

- Use <code>parallelism</code> to specify the number of pods running concurrently:

  ```
  spec:
      parallelism: 3
  ```

- Pods run in parallel until the desired number of completions is reached.
