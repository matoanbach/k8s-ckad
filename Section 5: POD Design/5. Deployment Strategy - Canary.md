## Steps to Implement a Canary Deployment

### 1. Primary Deployment:

- Deploy the original version of the application (e.g., version 1.0) using a Kubernetes <code>Deployment</code> object.
- Create a service to route traffic to this deployment.
- Label the pods with a common label (e.g., <code>app: frontend</code>) and a specific version label (e.g., <code>version: v1</code>).

- Example:

  ```
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
      name: myapp-primary
      labels:
          app: myapp
          type: front-end
  spec:
      template:
              metadata:
                  name: myapp-pod
                  labels:
                      version: v1
                      app: front-end
              spec:
                  containers:
                  - name: app-container
                  image: myapp-image:1.0
  replicas: 5
  selector:
      matchLabels:
          app: front-end
  ```

### 2. Canary Deployment:

- Deploy the new version of the application (e.g., version 2.0) using a separate Kubernetes <code>Deployment</code> object.
- Label the canary pods with the same common label (<code>app: frontend</code>) but with a different version label (<code>version: v2</code>).
- Example:
  ```
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
      name: myapp-canary
      labels:
          app: myapp
          type: front-end
  spec:
      template:
              metadata:
                  name: myapp-pod
                  labels:
                      version: v2
                      app: front-end
              spec:
                  containers:
                  - name: app-container
                  image: myapp-image:2.0
  replicas: 5
  selector:
      matchLabels:
          app: front-end
  ```

### 3. Service Configuration:

- Update the service to use the common label (e.g., <code>app: frontend</code>) as the selector.
- This ensures the service routes traffic to pods from both deployments.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
    name: my-service
spec:
    selector:
        app: front-end
```

### 4. Traffic Split:

1. Adjust the number of replicas in the canary deployment to control the percentage of traffic routed to it.
2. Traffic distribution is proportional to the number of pods in each deployment.
