## Blue-Green Deployment Implementation in Kubernetes

### Steps to Implement Blue-Green Deployment

1. Deploy the Current Version (Blue):

- Create a deployment for version <code>v1</code> of the application.
- Label the pods with <code>version=v1</code>.
- Create a service to route traffic to these pods using the <code>version=v1</code> label as the selector.

2. Deploy the New Version (Green):

- Create a separate deployment for version <code>v2</code> of the application.
- Label the pods with <code>version=v2</code>.
- Ensure no traffic is routed to these pods yet.

3. Test the New Version:

- Run necessary tests on the green deployment to ensure functionality.

4. Switch Traffic to the New Version:

- Update the <code>selector</code> of the service to use <code>version=v2</code>.
- This routes all traffic to the green deployment

## Code example

### 1. Blue Deployment (Version v1)

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-blue
  labels:
    app: myapp
    type: front-end
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: myapp-pod
      labels:
        version: v1
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app-container
          image: myapp-image:1.0
  replicas: 5
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      version: v1
```

### 2. Service for Blue Deployment

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
    name: my-service
spec:
    selector:
        version: v1
```

### 3. Green Deployment (Version <code>v2<code>)

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-green
  labels:
    app: myapp
    type: front-end
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: myapp-pod
      labels:
        version: v2
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app-container
          image: myapp-image:2.0
  replicas: 5
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      version: v2
```

### 4. Switching Traffic to Green Deployment

- Edit the service to update the selector:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    version: v2
```
