## Adding Labels

- Labels are defined in the metadata section of an object’s YAML definition. For example:

  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
  name: example-pod
  labels:
      app: app-one
      function: backend
  spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx
  ```

- To filter objects based on labels, you can use the <code>kubectl</code> command:

```
kubectl get pods --selector app=app-one
```

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: simple-webapp
    labels:
        app: App1
        function: Front-end
spec:
    containers:
    - name: simple-webapp
      image: simple-webapp
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

## Labels and Selectors in ReplicaSets

- ReplicaSets use labels and selectors to manage Pods. The labels in the template section define the labels for Pods created by the ReplicaSet, while the selector field connects the ReplicaSet to the Pods.

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: simple-webapp
  labels:
    app: App1
    function: Front-end
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: App1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: App1
        function: Front-end
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: simple-webapp
        image: simple-webapp
```

## Labels and Selectors in Services

- Work the same as ReplicaSet

## Annotations

- Annotations are used to record metadata that isn’t used for filtering or grouping. They can provide additional details, such as tool information, version numbers, or contact details.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
  annotations:
    maintainer: "admin@example.com"
    version: "1.0.0"
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx
```

## Print no headers and count:

```
kubectl get all --selector .... --no-headers | wc -l
```
