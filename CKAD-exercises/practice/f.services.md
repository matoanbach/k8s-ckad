### Create a deployment called foo using image 'dgkanatsios/simpleapp' (a simple server that returns hostname) and 3 replicas. Label it as 'app=foo'. Declare that containers in this pod will accept traffic on port 8080 (do NOT create a service yet)

### Create an nginx deployment of 2 replicas, expose it via a ClusterIP service on port 80. Create a NetworkPolicy so that only pods with labels 'access: granted' can access the pods in this deployment and apply it

kubernetes.io > Documentation > Concepts > Services, Load Balancing, and Networking > [Network Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)

> Note that network policies may not be enforced by default, depending on your k8s implementation. E.g. Azure AKS by default won't have policy enforcement, the cluster must be created with an explicit support for `netpol` https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-network-policies#overview-of-network-policy
