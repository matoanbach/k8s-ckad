### Create an nginx pod with a liveness probe that just runs the command 'ls'. Save its YAML in pod.yaml. Run it, check its probe status, delete it.

### Modify the pod.yaml file so that liveness probe starts kicking in after 5 seconds whereas the interval between probes would be 5 seconds. Run it, check the probe, delete it.
