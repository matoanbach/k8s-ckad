# Define, build and modify container images

- Note: The topic is part of the new CKAD syllabus. Here are a few examples of using **podman** to manage the life cycle of container images. The use of **docker** had been the industry standard for many years, but now large companies like [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/say-hello-buildah-podman-and-skopeo) are moving to a new suite of open source tools: podman, skopeo and buildah. Also Kubernetes has moved in this [direction](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/02/17/dockershim-faq/). In particular, `podman` is meant to be the replacement of the `docker` command: so it makes sense to get familiar with it, although they are quite interchangeable considering that they use the same syntax.

## Podman basics

### Create a Dockerfile to deploy an Apache HTTP Server which hosts a custom main page

<p>

```Dockerfile
FROM docker.io/httpd:2.4
RUN echo "Hello, World!" > /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/index.html
```

</p>
</details>

### Build and see how many layers the image consists of

```bash
:~$ podman build -t simpleapp .
STEP 1/2: FROM httpd:2.4
STEP 2/2: RUN echo "Hello, World!" > /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/index.html
COMMIT simpleapp

### Run the image locally, inspect its status and logs, finally test that it responds as expected

### Run a command inside the pod to print out the index.html file

### Tag the image with ip and port of a private local registry and then push the image to this registry

<details><summary>show</summary>
<p>

> Note: Some small distributions of Kubernetes (such as [microk8s](https://microk8s.io/docs/registry-built-in)) have a built-in registry you can use for this exercise. If this is not your case, you'll have to setup it on your own.

```bash
:~$ podman tag localhost/simpleapp $registry_ip:5000/simpleapp

:~$ podman push $registry_ip:5000/simpleapp
```

Verify that the registry contains the pushed image and that you can pull it
