### Introduction: The Need for Multi-Container Pods

- Modern applications often follow the microservice architecture, which involves breaking down a large monolithic application into smaller, independent, and reusable components. This approach offers several advantages:

  - Enables scaling individual components up or down
  - Simplifies modifications to each services without affecting the entire application

- However, there are cases where two services need to work together, such as:

  - A web server and a logging service
  - A wev server paired with a proxy

- In these scenarios:
  1. You don't want to merge the two services into a single container
  2. You want them to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently while working together

#### Solution: Use multi-container pods

### Why Multi-Container Pods

1. Shared lifecycle:
   - Containers in the same Pod are created, run, and destroyed together
2. Shared Network Namespace:
   - Containers in the same Pod can communicate using localhost
3. Shared Storage Volumes:
   - Containers can share storage volumnes mounted to the Pod

- This elimniates the need for setting up inter-Pod communication or shared storage between multiple containers.

### How to create a multi-container pod

- To add multiple containers to a Pod, you simply define multiple entries in the <code>containers</code> array in the Pod YAML file. For example:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: multi-container-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: web-server
    image: nginx
  - name: log-agent
    image: log-agent-image
```

- The container <code>containers</code> section is an array, allowing you to define multiple containers within the same pod

### Patterns of Multi-Container Pods

- There are three common patterns for designing multi-container pods

1. Sidecar pattern
   - The sidecar container runs alongside the main application container, providing auxiliary functionality
   - Example:
     - A web server container generates logs
     - A logging agent container collects and forwards these logs to a central server
2. Adapter pattern
   - The Adapter container processes data to make it compatible with external systems
   - Example:
     - Logs generated by multiple applications are in different formats
     - The adapter container standardize the log formats before forwarding them to the central logging server
3. Ambassador Pattern
   - The ambassador container acts as a proxy for external systems, handling communication logic
   - Example:
     - An application connects to different databases (development, testing, production) based on the environment
     - The ambassador container handles the routing logic, allowing the application to always communicate with localhost
