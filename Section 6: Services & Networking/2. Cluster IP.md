## ClusterIP Use Case

### 1. Pods run various components:

- Front-end web server pods.
- Back-end server pods.
- Key-value store pods like Redis.
- Database pods like MySQL.

### 2. Challenges:

- Pods have dynamic IPs, making it unreliable to hardcode IPs for communication.
- Deciding which pod to send traffic to when there are multiple replicas.

### 3. Solution:

- Create ClusterIP services to group pods by functionality (e.g., backend, Redis, MySQL).
- The service provides a single IP and name that other pods can use for communication.
- Traffic is distributed randomly among the pods behind the service.

## How ClusterIP Works

- A ClusterIP service groups a set of pods using selectors.
- It assigns a virtual IP address within the cluster, making it accessible only to other pods inside the cluster.
- Other pods communicate with the service using:
  - The ClusterIP address.
  - The service name, which Kubernetes resolves internally via DNS.

## Creating a ClusterIP Service

### Definition File

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: backend
spec:
  type: ClusterIP  # Default type; can be omitted.
  ports:
    - port: 80            # Port exposed by the service.
      targetPort: 80      # Port where the backend pods listen.
  selector:
    app: backend-app       # Matches pods labeled with app=backend-app.
```

### Accessing the Service

- From other pods:
  - Use the ClusterIP:
  ```
  curl
  ```
  - Use the service name:
  ```
  curl backend:80
  ```
