## What is Ingress?

- Ingress is a Kubernetes object that manages external HTTP/HTTPS access to services within a cluster.
- It acts as a Layer 7 Load Balancer with rules for routing requests based on URL paths or domain names.
- Ingress simplifies complex setups like URL-based routing, SSL termination, and traffic splitting.

## Comparison: Services vs. Ingress

### 1. Service:

- Provides internal/external access to pods.
- Types:
  - ClusterIP: Internal cluster communication.
  - NodePort: Maps traffic from a high-numbered port on nodes.
  - LoadBalancer: Provision a cloud-based external load balancer.
- Useful for exposing applications or communication between pods.

### 2. Ingress:

- Provides single-point external access with routing rules for multiple services.
  - Simplifies configurations like: - URL/path-based routing.
  - Domain-based routing.
  - SSL termination.
- Requires an Ingress Controller (e.g., NGINX, HAProxy, Traefik).

## Benefits of Ingress

- Consolidates traffic management for multiple services.
- Reduces cloud costs (e.g., fewer LoadBalancers).
- Centralized SSL certificate management.
- Enables advanced routing rules (e.g., traffic splitting, host/path routing).

## Ingress Architecture

### 1. Ingress Controller:

- Must be deployed in the cluster.
- Acts as a reverse proxy and dynamically configures itself based on Ingress rules.
- Examples: NGINX, HAProxy, Traefik, Istio, GCE.

### 2. Ingress Resources:

- Definition files containing rules and backend configurations.
- Specifies how traffic should be routed (e.g., paths, domains).

## How Ingress Works

### 1. Ingress Controller

- Monitors the cluster for new or updated Ingress Resources.
- Updates its internal configuration to handle incoming requests based on rules.

### 2. Ingress Resource Rules:

- Path-Based Routing:

  - Example:
    1. /watch → Video Service.
    2. /wear → Shopping Service.

- Domain-Based Routing:
  - Example:
    1. watch.my-online-store.com → Video Service.
    2. wear.my-online-store.com → Shopping Service.

## Key Components of Ingress

### 1. Ingress Controller:

- Exposes itself via a NodePort or LoadBalancer for external traffic.
- Examples: NGINX, Traefik.

### 2. Ingress Resource:

#### URL Path Routing

```yaml
# Ingress-wear.yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-wear
spec:
  backend:
    serviceName: wear-service
    servicePort: 80
```

```
kubectl create -f Ingress-wear.yaml
```

```
kubectl get ingress
```

```yaml
# Ingress-wear-watch
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-wear-watch
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /wear
        backend:
          serviceName: wear-service
          servicePort: 80
      - path: /watch
        backend:
          serviceName: watch-service
          servicePort: 80
```

```bash
kubectl describe ingress ingress-wear-watch
```

#### Domain routing

```yaml
# Ingress-wear-watch
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress

  name: ingress-wear-watch
spec:
  rules:
  - host: wear.my-online-store.com
    http:
      paths:

          serviceName: wear-service
          servicePort: 80
  - host: watch.my-online-store.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:

# Updated: Ingress

  <img src="https://github.com/matoanbach/k8s-ckad/blob/main/assets/sec%201/14.png"/>

- Now, in k8s version 1.20+ we can create an Ingress resource from the imperative way like this:

  - Format: <code>kubectl create ingress `<ingress-name>`--rule="host/path=service:port"</code>

  - Example: <code>kubectl create ingress ingress-test --rule="wear.my-online-store.com/wear\*=wear-service:80"</code>

```
create ingress ingress-wear-watch -n app-space --rule="/wear=wear-service:8080" -- --rule="/watch=watch-service:8080"
```

```
create ingress ingress-wear-watch -n app-space --rule="/wear=wear-service:8080" -- rule="/watch=video-service:8080"
```
