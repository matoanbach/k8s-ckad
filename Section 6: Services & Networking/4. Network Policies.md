## Network Policy Overview

- A Network Policy is a Kubernetes object used to control ingress/egress traffic for pods.
- Policies are namespace-scoped.
- They rely on labels and selectors to target pods and define rules for allowed traffic.

## Network Policy Components

1. API Version: networking.k8s.io/v1
2. Kind: NetworkPolicy
3. Metadata: Name of the policy (e.g., DB-Policy).
4. Spec:
   - Pod Selector: Specifies which pods the policy applies to (e.g., db-pod).
   - Policy Types: Defines whether the policy isolates ingress, egress, or both traffic types.
   - Rules: Specifies allowed traffic (e.g., traffic from the API server on port 3306).

## Example Network Policy YAML

- Below is an example of a network policy that allows only the API server pod to access the database pod on port 3306:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: db-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: db
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
            name: api-pod
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 3306
```

## How It Works

1. Pod Selector:
   - Targets the pod(s) with the label `app: db`.
   - Applies the policy to these pods.
2. Ingress Rule:
   - Allows traffic only from pods with the label `app: api-server`.
   - Limits traffic to port 3306 using the TCP protocol.
3. Isolation:
   - All other ingress traffic to the database pod is blocked.
   - Egress traffic from the database pod remains unrestricted because `egress` is not specified in `policyTypes`.
