## Types of Kubernetes Services

### 1. NodePort

- Maps a port on the node to a port on the pod.
- Allows external access to a pod via `<node-ip>:<node-port>`.
- NodePorts range: `30000-32767`.

### 2. ClusterIP

- Creates a virtual IP for internal cluster communication.
- Useful for connecting pods (e.g., front-end to back-end).

### 3. LoadBalancer

- Provisions a cloud-based load balancer (supported by providers).
- Distributes traffic among pods for scalability and availability.

## NodePort Services

### Key Ports in a NodePort Service

1. Target Port: The port on the pod where the application runs (e.g., 80).
2. Service Port: The port on the service itself (e.g., 80).
3. NodePort: The external port on the Kubernetes node (e.g., 30008).

- Example NodePort Service Defintion:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
    name: myapp-service
spec:
    type: NodePort
    ports:
    - targetPort: 80
      port: 80
      nodePort: 30008
    selector:
      app: myapp
      type: front-end
```

- Accessing the Service

  - Use the node's IP and NodePort:
    ```
    curl <node-ip>:<node-port>
    ```

## Services and Load Balancing

### Load Balancing Across Pods

- Services act as built-in load balancers.
- Automatically distribute traffic among all matching pods using a random algorithm.

### Multiple Pods Across Nodes

- A NodePort service spans across all nodes.
- You can access the application using the IP of any node in the cluster and the same NodePort.

## Advantages of ClusterIP Services

### 1. Dynamic Pod Management:

- Automatically adapts when pods are added or removed.

### 2. Load Balancing:

- Distributes traffic randomly across the pods behind the service.

### 3. Simplified Communication:

- Provides a single IP/name for accessing multiple pods.

### 4. Scalability

- Allows each layer of the application to scale independently.
